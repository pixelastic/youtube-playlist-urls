# youtube-playlist-urls

Pass a YouTube playlist url as input and get a list of all the urls of the
videos in this playlist.

## Usage

```
$ youtube-playlist-url https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQs838Y0UFjpxJmAtDIt96P2J7kuCcSTE
```

## Why?

I often download videos to watch them offline later. This makes my job way
easier.

Also, the YouTube API requires an API key. This script gets its data from the
public HTML version of the page.
